Flux Dissipator, one of the new Miniliths, now has research and a recipe.

Build 20
Fixed several issues with the ethereal jar which was causing desync issues between client and server
Fixed issue with mcmod.info file.
Changed how the fertilizer works.  It now uses herba to fertilize (ala the lamp of growth) which will cause normal plant
growth and can spread certain plants like mushrooms, lilypads and flowers.  Hydrating soil is now a free function
so you no longer need to worry about accidentally running out of aqua and having your farmland dry up.

Redid the Node Modifier thaumonomicon pages to better explain and illustrate the new node modifier mechanics.

Build 14

Extended the fertilizer to spread mushrooms and lilypads
Fixed RenderManager crash when using the mod on a dedicated server
